- ✅ Implemented connection-aware loading
- ✅ Optimized images with WebP conversion
- ✅ Added text compression with gzip
- ✅ Implemented efficient cache policies
- ✅ Reduced render-blocking resources
- ✅ Enhanced mobile-specific optimizations
- ✅ Improved low-end device support

## Deployment Checklist:

### 1. File Serving
- [ ] Ensure all minified versions (.min.css, .min.js) are being served
- [ ] Confirm critical CSS is being properly inlined in HTML
- [ ] Verify JS/CSS files are being served with correct MIME types
- [ ] Confirm preload/async/defer attributes working correctly

### 2. Image Optimization
- [ ] Run optimize-images.sh to create WebP versions of all images
- [ ] Verify mobile-specific images are available (-mobile.webp, -tablet.webp)
- [ ] Check image compression quality (aim for 80-85% quality)
- [ ] Confirm correct image dimensions for responsive layouts

### 3. Server Configuration
- [ ] Upload .htaccess file for Apache servers
- [ ] Use nginx.conf settings for NGINX servers
- [ ] Verify GZIP compression is active
- [ ] Test cache headers are working correctly
- [ ] Check proper MIME types configuration

### 4. Core Web Vitals Performance
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
- [ ] First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1
- [ ] First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.8s

### 5. Mobile Performance
- [ ] Test on low-end Android devices
- [ ] Test on iOS devices
- [ ] Verify connection-aware loading works
- [ ] Confirm mobile-specific optimizations activate
- [ ] Check font rendering performance

### 6. Tools for Testing
- PageSpeed Insights: https://pagespeed.web.dev/
- WebPageTest: https://www.webpagetest.org/
- Chrome DevTools Lighthouse
- GTmetrix: https://gtmetrix.com/
- Mobile-Friendly Test: https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly

### 7. Stats Counter Verification
- [ ] Check counter animations trigger on scroll into view
- [ ] Verify final values match data-count attributes
- [ ] Test animation performance on mobile devices
- [ ] Confirm observer disconnects after animation completes

### 8. Service Worker
- [ ] Confirm cache version updated to v3
- [ ] Verify correct files are being cached
- [ ] Test offline functionality
- [ ] Check service worker update process

### 9. File Size Budget
- [ ] Total HTML size < 100KB after compression
- [ ] Critical CSS < 15KB inlined
- [ ] JS < 300KB total minified and compressed
- [ ] Images average < 100KB each
- [ ] Total page size < 500KB on mobile

### 10. SEO Performance
- [ ] Check structured data with Google Rich Results Test
- [ ] Verify XML sitemap is accessible
- [ ] Confirm robots.txt is properly configured
- [ ] Test meta tags for geo location and Open Graph

## Regular Maintenance:
- Run image optimization script when new images are added
- Update service worker cache version after major updates
- Re-test performance after any significant changes
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
- Update minified CSS/JS when originals change
- Periodically check for outdated assets or practices
